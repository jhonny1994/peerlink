**Version:** 1.1 | **Date:** October 22, 2025

---

## App Name
**PeerLink** — emphasizing peer-to-peer connection with trust.

---

## Logo Concept
- **Symbol:** An interlinked monogram of the letters “P” and “L,” forming a single, continuous loop. This represents a seamless, secure, and direct connection.
- **Colors:** - Primary/Accent: Vibrant teal (`#008080`)
- **Style:** Flat, minimal, scalable, modern, and inspired by Material You principles. The logo must be simple enough to be recognizable at all sizes.

---

## App Icon
- **Design:** The app icon will be a simplified, iconic version of the "P" and "L" monogram. It should be instantly recognizable and designed to fit within adaptive icon shapes (e.g., squircle, circle, rounded square).
- **Style:** Flat, single accent color (teal) on a neutral light/dark background, ensuring high contrast.

---

## Visual Style & Color Palette
- **Primary:** Material You dynamic color system. The UI will generate a harmonious palette from a user’s wallpaper or a selected seed color.
- **Accent:** The primary teal (`#008080`) will be used as the default seed color and for key brand elements.
- **Backgrounds:** Standard Material You light and dark neutral surfaces to provide clarity and focus.
- **Typography:** Roboto or Google Sans. Must be clean and legible at all sizes.

---

## Fonts & Typography
- **Headings:** Roboto Bold (or equivalent), size adaptable for mobile/desktop.
- **Body:** Roboto Regular, comfortable line height.
- **Buttons & Labels:** Capitalized, bold for clarity.

---

## UI & Layout
- Minimalist, focusing on primary actions:
  - Large, accessible "Send" and "Receive" buttons.
  - A clear progress indicator that shows **percentage** and **transfer speed** (e.g., "55% - 12.5 MB/s").
  - Simple "Copy to Clipboard" button for the 6-digit code.
  - Consistent iconography aligned with Material Icons.
  - Ample whitespace; no clutter.
- **Error States:** UI must include simple, non-intrusive dialogs or snackbars for error messages. Text must be clear, calm, and provide guidance if possible (e.g., "Connection Failed. Please check your network and try again.").
- Use smooth, responsive animations for state transitions and user feedback.

## User Interface Feel
- Friendly but professional.
- Emphasizes trust, security, and simplicity.
- Rounded, approachable shapes and subtle motion.
